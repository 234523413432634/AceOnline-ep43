It also forced [Arlington City]''s self-government to increase their defences and led to the expansion of various military education institutions in Bygeniou much to the regret of its city council.';
$QUEST_101_DESCRIPTION				= 'The reconciliation between Bygeniou central government and Phillon planet was affected by the appearance of the Shrine. In April, 4855. [Union City], the central city of the western continents, was attacked and demolished by both the Phillon planets and Shrines coalition army due to the Shrines'' nationalist policy. Many of the Bygeniou government officials were  aroused dby this matter and politically declared war on the Phillon planet.';

$QUEST_102_QUEST_NAME				= 'Competence certification';
$QUEST_102_PRE_TALK					= 'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>, leader of the mercenary army: Welcome to our Bygeniou mercenary army. I have already received the data from your flight examination. You have quite impressive operational skills but I wonder how you will do in an actual fight. I would like to test you once again. Fly to the [Stone Ruins] right now and bring 3 [Bombing Exercisers] and 1 [Fighter Exerciser] back to me. These gears are made for exercise newbies, operating primarily based on AI systems. If you bring them to me I will recognize you as a member of our mercenary army. Of course you will also receive compensation for a job well done. As this is your first job, your reward will only be [320SPI]. Good luck! We''re counting on you!';
$QUEST_102_MID_TALK					= 'Mission already in progress. Bring down 3 [Bombing Exercisers] and 1 [Fighter Exerciser] at the Stone Ruins.';
$QUEST_102_SUCCESS_TALK				= 'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>, leader of the mercenary army: I am impressed... You''ve really done it. I have never seen this mission so properly and cleanly executed by a newcomer before. Your skills are truly remarkable. You are now a respected member of the FreeSKA Mercenary Army! If your performance continues to be this impressive you might just be sitting in my chair some day! Oh, by the way: your pay will be deposited to your online account by the time this message reaches you. From now on your pay will always be delivered in this fashion. Well then, go and get some rest. There is still much work left to do.';
$QUEST_102_DESCRIPTION				= 'The [FreeSKA] mercenary army of the Bygeniou central government is an unusual force that  includes both military discipline as well as personal freedoms into its culture; it is both a mercenary army and a regular force originally formed to suppress the rebel forces. After a sudden coup d''état the fighting was ended. The Bygeniou City government considered this precious force, the [FreeSKA Mercenary Army], as a waste of taxpayer''s money. No one had realized that this force would play a significant role throughout Bygeniou''s troubled future.';

$QUEST_103_QUEST_NAME				= 'Hunting Watchers';
$QUEST_103_PRE_TALK					= 'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>, leader of the mercenary army: How do you like our little mercenary force? You are getting along better than I expected. In fact, I am worried that you might be a little too confident for your work. So I would like you to take on a small request from the government. Do you know of a gear called [Watcher]? It is a monster from the Shrines'' planet that joined the Phillon to scout our territory. Although it has never been much of a threat to us and there is nothing important about the [Stone Ruins] our government feels that we shouldn''t show how poorly the Decans are doing right now. Your mission is to bring back the watchers'' computer boxes by taking those gears down. You will also need to acquire the computer boxes of the [Overwatchers] as well. As their name suggests, Overwatchers are more powerful than ordinary Watchers. You will receive [450SPI] as compensation. I wish you a pleasant journey!';
$QUEST_103_MID_TALK					= 'Mission already in progress. Bring down 5 [Watchers] and 2 [Overwatchers] at the Stone Ruins.';
$QUEST_103_SUCCESS_TALK				= 'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>, leader of the mercenary army: It looks like your work has been done successfully. These boxes should contain more data than our government needs. It is odd that they give us these kinds of tasks. I wonder what the government is planning right now... I am frankly annoyed by these kinds of chores. Anyway, with your successful work I have another chance to discuss this with the upper division. Thank you. Your have received your compensation. Until next time.';
$QUEST_103_DESCRIPTION				= 'The Watchers are of an old series of gears that has lost the ability to record and relay data. They now roam around with no particular purpose but the Bygeniou government denies this for the sake of propaganda: to warn the citizens of an attack by the Shrines/Phillon. A few citizens, though, came to know of this. They raised their voice and thus influenced the public sentiment that the Bygeniou City government is distorting the facts with sweet policy and makeshifts. Nowadays Bygeniou''s public sentiment is slowly shifting and with that, government support is declining day by day.';

$QUEST_104_QUEST_NAME				= 'The Ptera Cave';
$QUEST_104_PRE_TALK					= 'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>, leader of the mercenary army: Have you ever heard about monsters called Hornians? They are large bees from the Tylent Jungle who are typically not belligerent but can lash out against you if you get too close. According to intelligence sources, a few days ago one of the queen bees (aka [Hornian Queen]) came outside her lair to lay her eggs in the Ptera Cave. So the government has taken quite an interest in this information. If you can bring me 1~2 of these eggs, they are willing to develop an exclusive weapon for Hornian hunting. While this is not our typical line of work, the government has requested for us specifically to bring these back. I''ve decided to send you so you can learn more about the cave. Go to the [Ptera Cave] and bring back 2 samples of [Hornian DNA]. It''s easy to get: just shoot at the Hornian eggs. When you acquire the samples go straight to the end of the cave. Our retrieval system will bring you back to Bygeniou. It should be a cake-walk for someone like you. The pay for this mission will be [640SPI] and [Stat+1]. Good luck!';
$QUEST_104_MID_TALK					= 'Mission already in progress. Go to the Ptera Cave and bring 2 [Hornian Queen''s Egg DNA] by destroying the [Hornian Queen''s Eggs]. When finished, go through the cave.';
$QUEST_104_SUCCESS_TALK				= 'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>, leader of the mercenary army: I am impressed: The way you flew, it couldn''t have been your first time in the cave! It must have been a tough flight though, flying through such a narrow place. You exceeded my expectations. Anyway, your pay should have already been sent. Have you set your bonus stat yet? If you wish to have a powerful attack power use it on attack and if you wish for a high defence power you should use it on defence. So think carefully before deciding which stat to set. Detailed information on stats can be obtained from various sources. I will be meeting with the council again. We will discuss further tasks for our little army. We need to appear more active and busy to the people. What do you think? I''m concerned that this recent silence between us and the council is forecasting hard times. Well... I hope that my concerns are unfounded...';
$QUEST_104_DESCRIPTION				= 'No one knows for sure why a Hornian Queen who typically stays within her lair has laid eggs in the [Ptera Cave] which is not even Hornian territory. I doubt there is any simple reason behind this. This incident was merely a small result of the change on the Phillon planet. Decans were happy that they found a way to effectively eliminate Hornians, not realizing that their methods'' excessive energy consumption created difficulties for Decans, Vatallus and the Shrines.';

$QUEST_105_QUEST_NAME				= 'Bonebat Collector';
$QUEST_105_PRE_TALK					= 'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>, leader of the mercenary army: This request is to hunt a monster called [Bonebat]. Bygeniou City Institute needs a solvent. Fortunately the Bonebats'' gastric juice is very acidic, enough so that it can even melt steel. It is very easy to burn so it will be an effective substance for making a new Gear parts. When these new parts come out, the institute might even give them to us with a little discount. Not bad, huh? I know what you''re thinking and it may seem like an unimportant job but I have assigned this task to all the other mercenaries with your level of skill. Just go to the [Stone Ruins] and bring down [Bonebats]. Occasionally, they will drop a [Bonebat''s Gastric Juice Bag]. Gather 7 of these for me. You will be compensated with [680SPI]. I wish you a pleasant journey!';
$QUEST_105_MID_TALK					= 'Mission already in progress. Bring 7 [Bonebat''s Gastric Juice Bags] from the [Stone Ruins] by killing [Bonebats].';
$QUEST_105_SUCCESS_TALK				= 'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>, leader of the mercenary army: Thank you for doing such a chore without saying a word. As you know, we haven''t been given many assignments lately. By the way: I heard from a member of the government that Arlington rebels are trying to fully operate their own city plans. They are working to become self-sufficient, right down to the food and water. But they are so poor. It must be so hard for them to find food as it is such a infertile area. As they are readying their food supplies they are also preparing for war. When this happens, there will be a fierce series of battles between the two opposing sides. So be ready. You know what they say: the one who prepares for everything will be ready for anything.';
$QUEST_105_DESCRIPTION				= 'Unlike the Bygeniou government which is not concerned at all about the war, the Arlington rebel government is systematically devising its own city plan for a provisional stronghold. Arlington City is surrounded by a desert and an ice field so it has received food support from Vatallus who provided grains from a few fields and changed them into compound food. Naturally there has been a bit of dissatisfaction amongst the residents but with their passion for their [Alliance] and the [improved relations with Vatallus] the mood has increased day by day.';

$QUEST_106_QUEST_NAME				= 'The Shrines'' Lookout';
$QUEST_106_PRE_TALK					= 'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>, leader of the mercenary army: I have just recently received an urgent message from the government''s information department. The Watchers you helped to keep under control have resumed their activities. Rumours have it that they were not being controlled at all. Also a new monster called [Superwatcher] has appeared out of nowhere. The purpose of this mission is to go to the [Stone Ruins] and confirm the existence of the [Superwatcher]. If the rumours are true, shoot down the [Superwatcher] to bring the [Superwatcher''s Data Records]. The information department has informed me that superwatchers can be seen near [The Waterfall], [The Broken Windmill] and [The Broken Air Defence Artillery]. If you search these areas carefully, you should find them. Well, you cannot trust the officials 100% but it is the only source that we can rely on. You will receive [830SPI] as compensation. It is quite an ample pay for bringing down just one, isn''t it? I wish you a pleasant journey!';
$QUEST_106_MID_TALK					= 'Mission already in progress. Go to the [Stone Ruins] and bring down one [Superwatcher] to gather the [Superwatcher''s Data Records].';
$QUEST_106_SUCCESS_TALK				= 'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>, leader of the mercenary army: Great job. The record data that you have brought is now being examined. I think they have been recording the movement of our army secretly. Shrines... I never thought that they would be looking at us with such a clever camouflage. They must be either irritated by our movement or they are trying to gauge our relations with Arlington. The strangest part is that this kind of technology is beneath the Shrines; they didn''t need to use this crude methodology to find out about our army. It would be naive to automatically assume that this work had been done by Shrines. Well, the truth will be out there sooner or later. When the password for the data records is decoded it will all be clear. Anyway, you have done well. Go and take some rest.';
$QUEST_106_DESCRIPTION				= 'The encryption of the data that was gathered by bringing down the Superwatcher was different to the one used in the Deca Vs. Shrines war, so it took much more time to decode the password. They attempted to retrieve the remaining Superwatcher to examine it but it was nowhere to be found. After this incident the Bygeniou government has ordered the regular army to eliminate all Watchers and with this move most of the citizens became uneasy because while relations with Arlington are breaking down, the last thing anyone wants to do is to provoke the Shrines.';

$QUEST_107_QUEST_NAME				= 'Trouble In The Cave';
$QUEST_107_PRE_TALK					= 'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>, leader of the mercenary army: Do you remember when we asked you to gather Hornian DNA? With the DNA samples you sent us, they created a special item for the Hornian Queen. It is a machine that produces a certain radio wave causing reactions within those eggs containing the Hornian Queen''s DNA. I''m not interested in the petty details but the institute assures us that it produces a radio wave that is harmless to humans. So how about a simple mission back to the [Ptera Cave]? All you will need to do is to load the [Radio Wave Producer] and fly to the end of the cave. The radio wave will stimulate the eggs and in about 30 minutes only the skin of the eggs will remain and the rest will have dissolved. It is a simple mission, we will prepare your gear for. All you need to do is fly to the end of the cave. You will be rewarded [1,040SPI]! Considering what you need to do, it''s easy money, right? I wish you a pleasant journey!';
$QUEST_107_MID_TALK					= 'Mission already in progress. Pass through the Ptera Cave with a radio wave producer in the inventory.';
$QUEST_107_SUCCESS_TALK				= 'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>, leader of the mercenary army: I should apologize. I heard that many of the eggs had hatched already. I never imagined that the Ptera Cave would have become so dangerous in such a short time. I''m going to tell the intelligence department guys off. Only a week ago, there were only eggs flying around the air... I never expected [Ammons]. Ammons are monsters that used to be active at the Blackburn site. They are mostly younger [Ammons]. But why would they be here? The Blackburn site is a long way from the Ptera Cave. Ammons don''t just appear out of nowhere; someone must have moved their larvae there. Anyway, well done. With your brave action most of the eggs in the cave were eliminated. The [Radio Wave Producer] they retrieved will be redesigned to eliminate Hornians in the Tylent Jungle. Regarding the monsters in the cave I will inform the government and have it taken care of. Well done!';
$QUEST_107_DESCRIPTION				= 'Citizens who heard about this matter had the same doubt that Krueitoen Andersson had. Who brought those Ammons there and why? Could it be Shrines trying to stop the free movement in our territory? Or is it a tactic by the Arlington rebels? Bygeniou citizens were very confused with by all the recent events which have led to the rise of a pro Arlington group within Bygeniou. The people have become rather agitated.';

$QUEST_108_QUEST_NAME				= 'Tylent Jungle';
$QUEST_108_PRE_TALK					= 'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>, leader of the mercenary army: The Ptera Cave has become safe once again thanks to your work. Perhaps it''s time for you to make a round through the Tylent Jungle. According to Phillon natives, Tylent Jungle was a tropical rain forest with wide leaves, green vines and massive trees. With constant rain and a dense forest limiting access from the ground even Phillon natives could never really reach that region. There you will find a group of monsters known as <Hornians>. Based on previous intelligence Hornians have an organizational and hierarchical system with the Hornian Queen as their leader, the royal Hornians directly below her, Hornian Blazers below them and so on. But I''m sure that you already have quite an understanding of them due to your prior encounters. There are also other kinds of bugs living within the Tylent Jungle. Those bugs are not so belligerent so they won''t be much of a threat. As they do make it difficult to travel, however, the government leads regular hunting exercises against these bugs. We are routinely assigned to take down these pests. Go to the [Tylent Jungle] and bring back 7 [Nating Eggs], 5 [Hornians DNA] and 2 [Titanmoth Tentacles]. You will be compensated  with [1,290SPI].

Others might not agree with me, but I believe that Hornians possess intelligence. They are not just a normal group of bees. They are well organized, as is their division of labor. Also, I think that the highest ranking Hornian Queen knows something that we don''t.

What is strange about this statue is that when it was scanned it has a metal doll inside of it with bricks piled up around it. This statue has too many things to be answered, so we will send out a research team to check it out. Until then just wait for the results. Oh!

Also, rocks that are also shot out when the volcano is active are up to 30m in diameter and some weigh over 60 tons. When the volcano erupts, it spits out carbon dioxide and sulphur gas. Because of this gas, it is hard to get a clear vision. The Phillon natives believed that when the volcano erupted, <Rumain, the god of fire> was angry at them. The reason why this place has been named the Rumain Volcano is because natives believed that the god of fire, <Rumain> is sleeping there.';

Our clocks were fine and we were able to move swiftly back to our homeland with the help of new gears using the latest <Stealth> technology. When we were almost out of [Fantasy Flow] when all of our panels started to malfunction and fog blinded our eyes in the middle of the space. After that, an energy storm started from one corner of the space and created what I can only recall as a twist in the space-time-continuum. From there 3 gigantic gears appeared and attacked us without mercy. Due to their mighty fire power, we couldn''t do anything. The only thing we could find out about them is that their gear type name is [Bishop] and there was [G-ARK] written on their right shoulder. When our fighting power went down below 10%, which means that we could not fight back at all, they concentrated an energy force on the closed gate to open a new gateway. They told us to return the <Atum Project> and leave immediately. We neglected their offer and tried to escape through the gate that they opened. Fortunately, the [Skadi], [Lilith] and [Bishop] started fighting amongst themselves and most of us were able to go through the gate safely. But our rear was attacked by the [Skadi] and [Lilith], causing us to lose a certain part of the [Atum Project]. After going through the gate, we crash landed near a place that had less monsters living around it. But before we were able to feel any kind of relief that gigantic statue attacked us and all of our forces had to retreat back to our emergency capsule with some goods and the [Atum Project] in our hands. From then on, we only hoped for a rescue team to approach us. This is all I know and all that I have experienced.>';
$QUEST_165_DESCRIPTION				= 'This is report about the research on the [Gigantic God]: Within the stone statue there is a large metal bionic mech. We can''t even guess now how long it has been there. This thing wasn''t made with technology of the Shrine, Decans, or Phillons. When this mech came to the Phillon planet, the people of Phillon must have been astonished to see a gigantic metal god destroying everything with fire shooting out its eyes. With that in mind, they must have given it the name of <Rumain, god of fire>. This mech must have lost its energy and come here to get some planetary energy from this volcano. But before it could fulfill its purpose its energy must have reached zero and been left alone in this volcano. I think it chose this place because a large volcano is the best source to absorb as much planetary energy as needed. Anyway, Phillons must have been terrified seeing it and tried to seal it by putting bricks around it. After that, they worshipped this statue, calling it <Rumain, god of fire>. While they were doing so, they must have been terrified of its wakening. Then, our preceding forces must have awakened the mech''s main computer that has long been thought to have stopped functioning. I think that the gigantic god must have thought that it can recharge its energy to function again. Although it is a very small amount, the lava flowing down near it must have given it some planetary energy force to run its weapons. As a result we might have to fight the [Gigantic God], [Bishop] and [G-ARK] all together just because of this [Atum project].';

Also, rocks that are also shot out when the volcano is active are up to 30m in diameter and some weigh over 60 tons. When the volcano erupts, it spits out carbon dioxide and sulphur gas. Because of this gas, it is hard to get a clear vision. The Phillon natives believed that, when the volcano erupted, <Rumain, the god of fire> was angry at them.

When we were almost out of [Fantasy Flow] when all of our panels started to malfunction and fog blinded our eyes in the middle of the space. After that, an energy storm started from one corner of the space and created what I can only recall as a twist in the space-time-continuum. From there, 3 gigantic gears appeared, and attacked us without mercy. Due to their mighty fire-power, we couldn''t anything. The only thing we could find out about them is that their gear type name is [Bishop] and there was [G-ARK] written on their right shoulder. When our fighting power went down below 10%, which means that we could not fight back at all, they concentrated an energy force on the closed gate to open a new gateway. They told us to return the <Atum Project> and leave immediately. We neglected their offer and tried to escape through the gate that they opened. Fortunately, the [Skadi], [Lilith] and [Bishop] started fighting, and most of us were able to go through the gate safely. But our rear was attacked by the [Skadi], and [Lilith], causing us to lose certain part of the [Atum Project].

When this Mech came to Phillon planet, the people of Phillon must have been astonished to see a gigantic metal god destroying everything with fire shooting out its eyes. With that in mind, they must have given it a name of <Rumain, god of fire>. This Mech must have lost its energy and come here to get some planetary energy from this volcano. But before it could fulfil its purpose, its energy must have reached 0 and been left alone in this volcano. I think it chose this place because a large volcano is the best source to absorb as much planetary energy as needed. Anyway, Phillons must have been terrified to see this Mech and tried to seal it by putting bricks around it. After that they worshipped this statue, calling it <Rumain, god of fire>. While they were doing so, Phillons must have been terrified of its wakening. Then, our preceding forces must have awakened the Mech''s main computer that has long been thought to have stopped functioning. I think that the gigantic god must have thought that it can recharge its energy to function again. Although it is a very small amount, the lava flowing down near it must have stored some planetary energy force to run its weapons.

I guess you didn''t know about that until now, right? Our ancestors first set their foot on this place to find the planetary energy source for the <ATUM project>. However, a gigantic ocean earthquake occurred only about 1 year after the exploration, so most of the city sunk under the sea. Fortunately, most of the main facilities and manpower had been moved to [Bygeniou], minimizing the damage. Anyway, let me stop here with the history lesson and let us get down to some action. I order for us to start our investigation on this place, we will need to clean out this place first. Get rid of the [Crabtis] and [Laneige] in this area.

After this, a part of the facilities of [Concalante] was used to build the foundation of [Redline Beach]. However, due to a sea quake, all of the facilities sunk underwater, never to be seen again. Suddenly, strong energy force was observed in this area, bringing attention to the <ATUM project> research team. Their attention is very obvious.

Also, it was a large help for the first Deca & Vattalus to settle safely on Phillon planet by widening the radius of action with its greatly efficient engine.

However, there is a rumor that the Vattalus are making a new gear series according to this model. <Alpha-IX>: A patrol boat that has been produced for the purpose of building the base of Concalante. This is the first Decan sea attack boat. Its name derived from a number of failures. As it was the first one for them, they were having a lot of problems, which made them to finally succeed at the 9th test. This patrol boat was made to fight off Phillon monsters that were a large threat to Deca & Vattalus. On this ship, anti-aircraft missiles, cannon, and 1 <Ospery> were able to be equipped.

You soldiers will now belong to the <31st Strategic Battle Wing>. Our forces will declare our ambitions of advancing to the Pandea Continent for securing energy resources. You will stand at the front line to aid our advancement to the Pandea Continent, so if you do well, there will be a great reward for you. How about that? Are you ready to participate in our new plans?';
$QUEST_1101_SUCCESS_TALK			= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: Thank you, It is a great honour for me to work with such great pilots like you guys. I believe that you will become a great power to our <31st Strategic Battle Wing>. To briefly explain about today, we will start from the city and advance to Pandea Continent to secure our natural resources and to broaden our land. No one knows what really lurks in Pandea Continent so your task is to protect our forces'' energy extraction team. I wish you luck in your mission.';

$QUEST_1102_QUEST_NAME				= 	'Search At Khalua Beach';
$QUEST_1102_PRE_TALK				= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: As Arlingtons'' forces have concluded an armistice with ours, we will advance to the Pandea Continent, where the Vattallus forces remain in order to secure the natural resources.  Before, we will need to find the right place for our advance. For the time being, I would like you to check [Khalua Beach] behind the [Bach Mountain Chain]. You will see many remains of the Phillons at [Khalua]. Of those, the [Ksar] is very dangerous with a strong light ray that is a huge threat for pilots in the area. Take off right now to [Khalua Beach] and get rid of the Phillon and Shrine remains.';
$QUEST_1102_MID_TALK				= 	'Mission already in progress. Bring down 10 [Ksar], [Erion] and [Scorlion] at [Khalua Beach] and return to [Bygeniou City].';
$QUEST_1102_SUCCESS_TALK			= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: Due to success from this mission, the FreeSKA mercenary army will belong to <31st Strategic Battle Wing>. Pilots who are fighting for our nation have successfully completed this mission to help and find [Nubarke Cave], making our job much easier. But as remains of Phillons have been found, we are expecting fierce retaliation. Please do your best in your mission.';
$QUEST_1102_DESCRIPTION				= 	'By searching Khalua Beach, we were able to find out that Phillons and Shrines have built Nubarke Cave to attack Bygeniou City. This mission let us know that in order to penetrate the Pandea Continent, we will have to fight the Phillons. It is a very ominous cave, but as more pilots have joined the team, it has gotten stronger and it will make our job to secure the resources easier. Krueitoen Andersson found the Phillons reappearance and discovery of the cave very alarming.';

$QUEST_1103_QUEST_NAME				= 	'CODE-BCU01375';
$QUEST_1103_PRE_TALK				= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: Although your mission at [Khalua Beach] was done perfectly, trust hasn''t really built up among the cabinet members. I will give you a chance to become someone more special. In order for us to enter the Pandea Continent, we will need to eliminate the remaining Phillons. Mission CODE-BCU01375 is to search the inside of [Nubarke Cave] and to gather information to help us fly safely. Use this opportunity to make yourself clear to the top.';
$QUEST_1103_MID_TALK				= 	'Mission already in progress. Gather the four [Phillon Traces] at [Nubarke Cave].';
$QUEST_1103_SUCCESS_TALK			= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: Due to the success of this mission, you have given the cabinet members the trust they have longed for. Even though this mission came from my head, you have not failed to meet my expectations. With this [CODE-BCU01375] mission you have made <31st Strategic Battle Wing> famous. But this will also create more enemies for us. Remember the fighting method that you learned through fighting Phillons and use it to penetrate the Pandea Continent and secure our energy sources.';
$QUEST_1103_DESCRIPTION				= 	'With the great success of the 31st Strategic Battle Wing''s Nubarke Cave exploration, Bygeniou secured their road to resources. Krueitoen Andersson received information from an Arlington mole that Arlington is also building a bridge to enter the Pandea Continent. With this information, Krueitoen Andersson had the inauspicious thought that they might again be our enemy sooner or later.';

$QUEST_1104_QUEST_NAME				= 	'Unknown Enemy';
$QUEST_1104_PRE_TALK				= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: A Report about a raid from unknown enemies just came in. [Scouts] of an unknown nation are scouting our forces on the [Orina Peninsula]. Take off right away to bring them down and find out what nation they come from by hacking into their system. When you bring them down, you will be able to gather information. Good luck.';
$QUEST_1104_MID_TALK				= 	'Mission already in progress. Bring down [Scouts] on the [Orina Peninsula] and bring back 5 [Data Boxes].';
$QUEST_1104_SUCCESS_TALK			= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: Hmm. The ATUM research facility has analysed the information you brought back. They found out that it is a gear from Vattallus. Our cabinet members are all very confused about its appearance in the area. They have always been a friendly force to us, but if they keep it up like this we will have to think of them as our enemy and bring them down. Take some rest before the next mission. Out!';
$QUEST_1104_DESCRIPTION				= 	'After finding out that the airframe was from Vatallus, the Decan government was very surprised. But after a long battle on Zebraldo Continent, they lacked the resources and had to bring back something to Pandea in order for them to survive. With clouds of war over them, the competition for resource securing was just beginning.';

$QUEST_1105_QUEST_NAME				= 	'Holy Land';
$QUEST_1105_PRE_TALK				= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: According to an old legend, the [Daisy Big Catchment Area] was labelled as the land of life and holiness. But with the Phillons out of sight, this land is also losing its force to the Shrines and Vattallus. People at the ATUM research institute have found out that this place has got a gigantic amount of buried resources. But a monster has eaten up our exploration equipment, set up for research purposes. This exploration equipment holds the exact data of this place, so bring it back by bringing down the monsters called [Heinous] and [Seifer].';
$QUEST_1105_MID_TALK				= 	'Mission already in progress. Bring down [Heinous] and [Seifer] at the [Daisy Big Catchment Area] and bring back 5 of each [Air Type Explorers] and [Land Type Explorers].';
$QUEST_1105_SUCCESS_TALK			= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: By checking your exploration record, I see that there exists a very mysterious force that has never been seen before. This Enemy might show up any minute, anywhere. So be careful when flying in this area. Out.';
$QUEST_1105_DESCRIPTION				= 	'Bygeniou and Arlington entered what Phillons call their holy land. Without knowing about the real danger lurking there, they kept on broadening their land for their own gain. On who''s side the gods of war will stand, only time will tell.';

$QUEST_1106_QUEST_NAME				= 	'Search and Clear';
$QUEST_1106_PRE_TALK				= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: A few days ago, our advance force was attacked by Arlington airframes. Their airframe was much faster and stronger than we imagined. Before they send their envoy to their home, find them and take them down at the [Daisy Big Catchment Area]. This mission is the most important job for Bygeniou as of now, so take special caution in this mission.';
$QUEST_1106_MID_TALK				= 	'Mission already in progress. Bring down 15 [Unknown Gears] at the [Daisy Big Catchment Area].';
$QUEST_1106_SUCCESS_TALK			= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: I would like to show my respect to you for such a perfect completion. As we are now considering to go to battle with Arlington, my burden is lessened knowing that you will be here for Bygeniou. I wish you will do your utmost in your job. I will be expecting much more from you.';
$QUEST_1106_DESCRIPTION				= 	'With Vattallus disguised as Arlingtonites, Bygeniou was fooled by their move and started their advance to bring much more energy resources from Pandea. But both nations advance to a same target, making their fight between each other obvious. Bygeniou was attacked by Arlington´s airframe and weapon. Bygeniou could not be more confused. Also, commander in chief, Dochika Ivaneuf was furious about a faster and stronger attack of their enemy. Dochika Ivaneuf sent a strong warning to Arlington government about this matter. He also requested public apologies. This made Arlington even more confused than Bygeniou because they had never attacked them and kept their promise. With Arlington''s response, Dochika Ivaneuf warned them that if this was to happen again, they would not just stand by and watch them do such terrible things. This incident came to a close for now, but Bygeniou came to neglect the need for a truce between Arlington due to this attack.';

$QUEST_1107_QUEST_NAME				= 	'Enemy Contact!';
$QUEST_1107_PRE_TALK				= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: Within seconds after us attacking the [Daisy Big Catchment Area], Arlington airframes started their attack on our base. Arlington airframes will be at the [Daisy Big Catchment Area] right now, so go there and save our advance force from elimination. Their escape route will need to be secured, so earn some time for them.';
$QUEST_1107_MID_TALK				= 	'Mission already in progress. Hunt down 10 of each [Phillon Fighters], [Taimai] and [Guesper] within 10 minutes at the [Orina Peninsula].';
$QUEST_1107_SUCCESS_TALK			= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: With your sacrifice, our advance force at the [Orina Peninsula] was able to come out safely. With this second attack from Arlington, our government had no choice but to break their truce and attack them with full power. When we start our attack, your help will become a huge backing for our force, so get some rest for now.';
$QUEST_1107_DESCRIPTION				= 	'Harmed by sudden attacks from Arlington, Bygeniou didn''t have more time to waste in this matter. They immediately broke their truce and prepared to declare war on Arlington. A plot by Vattallus to break the truce between Bygeniou and Arlington couldn''t have been more successful. Without knowing of Vattallus'' intervention, two nations started preparing for unnecessary battle.';

$QUEST_1108_QUEST_NAME				= 	'Emergency! Warning!!!';
$QUEST_1108_PRE_TALK				= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: Report after the alarm: We will immediately withdraw all of our forces from [Nubarke Cave]. What we thought was that Arlington''s attack was really the attack of Vattallus'' new airframes. But we think that it is impossible for us to confront them with our powers. For now, we need to evacuate asap. Destroy the Phillon airframes at [Nubarke Cave].';
$QUEST_1108_MID_TALK				= 	'Mission already in progress. Get rid of [Mega Elos], [Mega Naros] and [Mega Gros] at [Nubarke Cave] and try to come back in one piece.';
$QUEST_1108_SUCCESS_TALK			= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: Our government is very confused about what is going on right now. It is even more surprising that the DePontt Corporation built the new airframe for Vattallus. We never thought of them becoming as strong as they are now. It seemed impossible for them to recover from the ruin they were in. I admit our mistake of misjudging the airframe as one of Arlington''s. We will need to keep our front line and see what the Vattallus are really up to. Get some rest before the next mission.';
$QUEST_1108_DESCRIPTION				=	'Bygeniou was speechless when they found out that this attack really came from from Vattallus and not from Arlington. But they couldn''t return to their normal friendly status with Arlington that they had kept for some time. With accumulated resources and manpower in their hands, Vattallus commenced a full attack on Bygeniou, making cabinet members of Bygeniou planning more for defence than attack.';

$QUEST_1109_QUEST_NAME				= 	'Destruction Of The Shrine Ammunition Base';
$QUEST_1109_PRE_TALK				= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: Our grand mission of entering the Pandea Continent is becoming harder and harder. We have received information about the Vattallus trying to re-operate the [Shrine Ammunition Base] in [Khalua Beach] on the west of the [Bach Mountain Chain]. I want you to go straight to [Khalua Beach] and destroy the [Shrine Ammunition Base]. This mission must be accomplished no matter what the cost is. I wish you good luck in your job.';
$QUEST_1109_MID_TALK				= 	'Mission already in progress. Destroy the [Shrine Ammunition Base] at [Khalua Beach].';
$QUEST_1109_SUCCESS_TALK			= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: Although we have succeeded in destroying the [Shrine Ammunition Base], we made a huge mistake in our advance. First, the Vattallus disguised themselves as Arlington to start the war but we couldn''t do anything about it. Also, we must enter back into the war stricken world by our mistake. While getting some rest, also prepare for the next battle. Out.';
$QUEST_1109_DESCRIPTION				=	'The Decans not only failed in establishing a consolidated government, but their intimacy also came to a devastating end. Whilst they were fighting each other, Vattallus grew their force to outmatch Arlington and Bygeniou. Even more, they started developing new technologies to proceed with the Atum project. With the Decans in a huge crisis, the pilot mercenary army was preparing for the new war ahead of them.';

$QUEST_1110_QUEST_NAME				= 	'The Return Of The Heroes';
$QUEST_1110_PRE_TALK				= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: We received news just now that the heroic Vattallus pilots have rejoined our forces. They had left the <FreeSKA Mercenary Army> before disorganization. By having them back into our forces, we were able to regain the morale we longed for. Although we are behind in numbers and abilities, I believe the return of such heroes will make our forces more stable. Will you help us again in our battle?';
$QUEST_1110_SUCCESS_TALK			= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: Thank you. It''s a great honour that we have such a great pilot like you under our government. I will concentrate all the information we can gather and provide it to you to prevent the same thing from happening again. We only have to move forward from now on. With this in mind, I attached warp gate data, making your battle much easier. From next mission on, you will be confronting much stronger Vattallus, so be prepared.';

$QUEST_1111_QUEST_NAME				= 	'<Operation Recovery> Part 1';
$QUEST_1111_PRE_TALK				= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: From now on, you will enter the 1st Phrase of our core plan <Operation Recovery> with our returned heroes of the past. Whatever order that you might receive from the top must be met. In return, reward and maintenance will be done perfectly. For now, get rid of enemy airframes at [Khalua Beach] with our old heroes to make them feel that they are at home again. Be specially careful about the airframes you met before. They are upgraded to become much stronger. Out.';
$QUEST_1111_MID_TALK				= 	'Mission already in progress. Bring down much stronger [Ogryns], [Brund Melins] and [Phillon Scouts] at [Khalua Beach].';
$QUEST_1111_SUCCESS_TALK			= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: It seems that the return of our heroes not only improved our morale but also our fighting abilities. But you must understand that there''s more when it comes to fighting the enemy. Your team mates will always stand by your side to help you and you will need to do the same for your team mates. Be sure to be accurate and quick when in battle. I hope you''ll do that in the next mission. Get some rest for now. Great work!';

$QUEST_1112_PRE_TALK				= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: Now I''ll be ordering the second phase of <Operation Recovery>. Whatever commands you might receive from the top must be met. In return, reward and maintenance will be done perfectly. Failing to do so will bring about severe punishment. All members will immediately move to [Orina Peninsula] and destroy [Viper Series] airframes. According to our scout team, the Vattallus'' forces have already widened their influence in [Orina Peninsula]. If we give up this place to them, we''ll be doomed. I want you pilots to get together and help them pack their travel luggage. Out.';
$QUEST_1112_MID_TALK				= 	'Mission already in progress. Bring down [Vattallus Scouts] at [Orina Peninsula] and come back to [Bygeniou City] in one piece.';
$QUEST_1112_SUCCESS_TALK			= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: <Operation Recovery> was an operation to counter attack the Vattallus'' forces. With your help, we were able to kick them out of the [Orina Peninsula]. But we must also recognize all those who sacrificed their life for the same cause. Well done anyway. Get some rest for now.';

$QUEST_1113_QUEST_NAME				= 	'<Operation Recovery> Part 3';
$QUEST_1113_PRE_TALK				= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: Now I will be ordering the third phase of <Operation Recovery>. Whatever order you might receive from the top must be met. In return, reward and maintenance will be done perfectly. Failing to do so will bring severe punishment. You will immediately move to [Gjert Road] and destroy the [ANI Symbol]. I know that confronting only Vattallus is hard enough, but for now, we need to push back Arlington to make our penetration of the new continent much easier. Hit their core and bring it down immediately.';
$QUEST_1113_MID_TALK				= 	'Mission already in progress. Destroy a [ANI Symbol] at the [Gjert Road] and return to Bygeniou City.';
$QUEST_1113_SUCCESS_TALK			= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: <Operation Recovery> was an operation to counter attack on the Vattallus'' forces. But as Arlington is also becoming a big obstacle, we''ll also need to restraint them. With that in mind, our mission was of high importance, and I see accomplishing this mission as a great success. As the advancement of Arlington has slowed down, we will need to speed up ours. Out.';
$QUEST_1113_DESCRIPTION				= 	'<Operation Recovery> Phase 3 complete.';

$QUEST_1114_QUEST_NAME				= 	'<Operation Recovery> Phase 4';
$QUEST_1114_PRE_TALK				= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: Now I will be ordering the fourth phase of <Operation Recovery>. Whatever order you might receive from the top must be met. In return, reward and maintenance will be done perfectly. Failing to do so will bring about severe punishment. I want everyone to go immediately to the [Orina Peninsula] and destroy the [Vattallus Advance Base]. Through the battle in [Nubarke Cave], we were able to stop Vattallus from entering Bygeniou City. But as we have started a war with Vattallus, I believe it will keep going on if we do not kick them out of the Pandea Continent. I believe you will do well in this mission.';
$QUEST_1114_MID_TALK				= 	'Mission already in progress. Destroy the mechanic force [Black Widows] at the [Orina Peninsula] and obtain [Information on a Vattallus Airframe].';
$QUEST_1114_SUCCESS_TALK			= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: <Operation Recovery> allowed us to obtain vital information about Vattallus before we started our counter attack. According to investigation at the ATUM  research institute, we were able to discover various new technologies. We also found out that a new energy resource from Pandea was used on the latest airframe. Their missile is just as two of ours, so be special careful about it next time you engage in the mission. Out.';
$QUEST_1114_DESCRIPTION				= 	'Last phase of <Operation Recovery> and its casualties: Completely destroyed or lost gears: 2076 units, pilots killed in action or prisoners of war: 206 people, total amount of used up supplies: 3,214,563,10000 SPI. This is all for now.';

$QUEST_1115_PRE_TALK				= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: We had to make a huge sacrifice through 4 stages of our mission. But by doing so, we were able to return to our previously set the Maginot Line to the [Orina Peninsula]. But with guerilla attacks from the Vattallus force at the [Orina Peninsula], [Nubarke Cave] and [Khalua Beach] we can''t only concentrate on our front line. Take off right now and get rid of those Vattallus airframes and leftovers.';
$QUEST_1115_MID_TALK				= 	'Mission already in progress. Destroy five of each at designated places. [Phillon Fighters] at the [Orina Peninsula], [Vattallus Scouts] at [Nubarke Cave], and [Ogryns] at [Khalua Beach]. When finished, return safely to [Bygeniou City].';
$QUEST_1115_SUCCESS_TALK			= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: Well done. Only with your help were we able to stop their advance. But you know as much as I do that there are much stronger enemies in places we haven''t been to yet. Right now, cabinet members are still thinking about our future plans. Whether to concentrate our forces and finish off the war in a short time, or to advance slowly whilst checking the status of Arlington and Vattallus, will need to be decided. By the looks of such heroic actions like yours, it seems that we''ll need to be more aggressive, but this is not for me to decide alone. Wait for the next mission and get some rest.';
$QUEST_1115_DESCRIPTION				= 	'Bygeniou and Arlington both knew that Vattallus was far better than they were at that point. But the mercenary army was outdoing Vattallus with its strategy and skills. However, they hadn''t faced all of Vattallus weapons. Only the low level stage was open to them, which means there was a much rougher road ahead for both Bygeniou and Arlington.';

$QUEST_1116_QUEST_NAME				= 	'Extraction Of Special Energy';
$QUEST_1116_PRE_TALK				= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: Our last mission at the [Orina Peninsula] was accomplished only by brilliant skills of you guys. But our government is seriously lacking in energy. According to the ATUM research institute, there is a much stronger energy form called [Korium Mineral]. It is 50 times stronger than existing energy sources and it can be found in large numbers within [Guespers]. So destroy [Guespers] to obtain the [Korium Mineral]. Out.';
$QUEST_1116_MID_TALK				= 	'Mission already in progress. Destroy [Guespers] at the [Orina Peninsula] and bring back 20 units of [Korium Mineral].';
$QUEST_1116_SUCCESS_TALK			= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: With the special substances you guys brought back we were able to regain our power.

Go back now and get some maintenance done on your gear for your next mission. Out.';
$QUEST_1116_DESCRIPTION				= 	'Great work of the 31st Strategic Battle Wing allowed Bygeniou to obtain a special resource to solve their thirst for energy. But what they didn''t know was that whilst they were benefiting from Vattallus, Vattallus didn''t stay passive. They were soon to show new resources and weapons to shock the Decans.';

$QUEST_1117_PRE_TALK				= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: This is your next mission. The Vattallus have used our technology to build their own resource collector we used to obtain our resources. But we can''t tolerate this any more.

$QUEST_1117_SUCCESS_TALK			= 	'Message from <Krueitoen Andersson>: Well done! By destroying the resource collector [Cordoba], the production of the [Viper] will slow down.

$QUEST_1117_DESCRIPTION				= 	'After the retreat of the Vattallus in the area, Bygeniou grew in their power of influence. But even with silence from the Vattallus side, Krueitoen Andersson couldn''t be more worried.

Be prepared and have some maintenance done on your gear. Out.';
$QUEST_1118_DESCRIPTION				= 	'After Bygeniou cleared out Vattallus'' attacking forces, they set their mind to bring down both Vattallus and Arlington once and for all. But Bygeniou missed out a very important part: It is that Vattallus doesn''t only consist of viper units. They had a much stronger strategic weapon behind their back. They were just waiting for both forces to come to them.';

This time, your role is to destroy the special unit, the [Echelon] that is made out of super nano mechanic technology. The Echelon itself is so powerful that many pilots have been put away by it.

It is unbelievable that such a strong unit like [Echelon] was forged by Vattallus. It is powerful, but I think with you guys working together as a team, there can be nothing stronger. Please wait for the next mission.';

Although they have a unique technology of putting together bionic and mechanical engineering, I believe that the abilities of 31st strategy battle wing are far greater than those of Vatallus. Go and get some rest before our advance';
$QUEST_1120_DESCRIPTION				= 	'As Bygeniou already knew of Vatallus'' plans, they were able to stop them from carryin them out. As they focused more on Arlington rather than Bygeniou, the latter still had one more trump card left. Without their anticipation, Bygeniou was planning to attack further into Vatallus'' soil.';

This place is a holy place for the Phillons, as they think of this place as where their god was born.
